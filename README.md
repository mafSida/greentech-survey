## Project Overview

This responsive survey form was created for the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification course. This project aims to demonstrate skills in HTML and CSS by building a functional and visually appealing survey form for GreenTech Solutions, a fictional company specializing in eco-friendly products and sustainable technology solutions.

## Technologies and Solutions Used

- **HTML5:** Structured the content and ensured semantic markup for accessibility.
- **CSS3:** Used modern CSS techniques including Flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.
- **Google Fonts:** Integrated custom fonts (Lora and Montserrat) to enhance the visual appearance.
- **Modern Normalize:** Applied a CSS reset for cross-browser consistency.
- **Responsive Web Design:** Ensured the form adjusts for different screen sizes and devices.
- **Accessibility:** Focused on providing clear labels, instructions, and a good user experience for all users, including those using screen readers.

During this project, I learned:
- How to create a responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and media queries.
- Best practices for ensuring accessibility in forms, including the use of semantic HTML tags and proper labels.
- How to integrate custom fonts and SVG icons to improve the overall aesthetic of a web form.
